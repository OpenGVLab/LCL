# Latent Compression Learning (LCL)

The official implementation of the paper "Vision Model Pre-training on Interleaved Image-Text Data via Latent Compression Learning".

We introduce the Latent Compression Learning (LCL) to pre-train vision models from scratch with interleaved image-text data. Compared to existing methods (e.g., CLIP, auto-regressive text generation), our proposed LCL is the first to achieve both

* Learning vision models from scratch
* Training on interleaved image-text data

## üìà Results

### Pre-training on MMC4 Dataset

![result_interleaved](./assets/result_interleaved.png)

Our LCL pre-training significantly outperforms all other methods in the caption tasks and is on par with the best paired pre-training methods on classification and retrieval tasks.

### Comparison with OpenCLIP

![result_main_multimodal](./assets/result_main_multimodal.png)

When both using LAION-400M data, our LCL pre-training achieves similar performance to OpenCLIP. When combined with MMC4 data, our LCL pre-training outperforms OpenCLIP, especially in caption and multi-modal dialogue tasks. For a fair comparison, the total number of images seen during pre-training is 13B.


## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Install

This code is built upon [OpenCLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip), you can refer to their repository for setup.

### Training LCL

The example training scripts are provided in [`./scripts`](./scripts). You can refer to [OpenCLIP](https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip?tab=readme-ov-file#training-clip) for more ways to launch training.

**Training on LAION-400M:** Run [`./scripts/lcl_vit_b_32_laion.sh`](./scripts/lcl_vit_b_32_laion.sh). The corresponding model config is [here](./src/open_clip/model_configs/LCL_ViT-B-32_laion.json).

**Training on MMC4:** TODO, will be completed before 2024/6/15.

## Pre-trained Checkpoints

The following are the checkpoints of our pre-trained vision encoders. (Some of the checkpoints will be available in the future based on the schedule)

| model | data | epoch | download |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| ViT-B/32 | LAION-400M | 32 | eta: 2024/06/15 |
| ViT-B/32 | LAION-400M + MMC4 | 32 | TBD |
| ViT-B/32 | LAION-2B + CC-Interleaved | 15 | eta: 2024/06/25 |
| ViT-L/14 | LAION-400M | 32 | TBD |
| ViT-L/14 | LAION-400M + MMC4 | 32 | TBD |
| ViT-L/14 | LAION-2B + CC-Interleaved | 15 | TBD |

**CC-Interleaved is a newly collected interleaved image-text dataset with over one billion images, which will be released soon.**

**NOTE:** We conduct large-scale pre-training with internal efficient code, which will not be released due to intellectual property reasons. This released version¬†has been verified and can reproduce the results of ViT-B/32 on LAION-400M dataset.
